## 7. Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that soil erosion can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using machine learning models. The Random Forest model provides the best balance of performance and interpretability. The dataset size of 50,000 samples provides sufficient coverage for training robust models, though expansion to more regions could improve generalizability.

The key factors influencing soil erosion are:
1. Slope characteristics
2. Vegetation cover (NDVI)
3. Rainfall patterns
4. Soil moisture
5. Elevation

These findings align with established soil erosion theory and provide a solid foundation for further model development and practical applications.
